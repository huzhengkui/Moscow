Building Smart Contracts with Remix
=======================

We prepared a thorough workshop that will help you build your own DApp. We will show you how to build and deploy smart contracts, how to deploy them and how to interact with them. Later in the workshop you will also learn how to connect your frontend with blockchain by using web3.js.
