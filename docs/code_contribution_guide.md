Code contribution guide
=======================

Remix is an open source tool and we encourage anyone to help us improve our tool.
You can do that by opening issues, giving feedback or by contributing a pull request
to our codebase.

Remix application is built with Javascript and it doesn't use any framework, we only
rely on selected set of NPM modules, like `yo-yo`, `csjs-inject` and others. Check out
package.json file to learn more about the stack.
